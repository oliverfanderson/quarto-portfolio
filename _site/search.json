I then plotted the female data again to see the new cleaned graph.\n\n\nLook at the code\n# there are so many events so lets choose a few events that represent some categories\n# distance: 10k, 5k\n# mid-distance: 800m, 1500m\n# sprints: 100m, 400m\n# jumps: long jump, triple jump\n# throws: shot put, discus, javelin\nathletics$event <- gsub(\"Athletics Women's \", \"\", athletics$event)\nathletics$event <- gsub(\"Athletics Men's \", \"\", athletics$event)\n\nathletics <- athletics %>% \n  filter(event == c(\"10,000 metres\", \"5,000 metres\", \"800 metres\",\"1,500 metres\", \"100 metres\", \"400 metres\", \"Long Jump\", \"Triple Jump\", \"Shot Put\", \"Discus Throw\", \"Javelin Throw\"))\n\nathletics %>% \n  ggplot(aes(height, weight, color=event))+\n  geom_point(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the code\n# this is still too much, let's group them\nathletics <- athletics %>% \n  mutate(event_type = case_when( \n  event %in% c(\"10,000 metres\", \"5,000 metres\") ~ \"Distance\",\n  event %in% c(\"800 metres\",\"1,500 metres\") ~ \"Mid-distance\",\n  event %in% c(\"100 metres\", \"400 metres\") ~ \"Sprints\",\n  event %in% c(\"Long Jump\", \"Triple Jump\", \"High Jump\") ~ \"Jumps\",\n  event %in% c(\"Shot Put\", \"Discus Throw\", \"Javelin Throw\") ~ \"Throws\",\n))\n\n# now it's time to subset by sex\nathletics_f <- athletics %>% \n  filter(sex==\"F\")\n\nathletics_m <- athletics %>% \n  filter(sex==\"M\")\n\n# plot female\nathletics_f %>% \n  ggplot(aes(height, weight, color=event_type))+\n  geom_point(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a much easier graphic to understand so I decided to beautify it.\n\n\nLook at the code\n# putting it together\n(( p1 <- athletics_f %>% \n  ggplot(aes(height, weight, color=event_type))+\n  geom_point(alpha=0.75)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_color_discrete_qualitative(\"Dark 3\")+\n  labs(title=\"Body Composition of Female \\nOlympic Medalists by Event\\n\", x=\"Height (cm)\", y=\"Weight (kg)\", color=\"Type of Track & Field Event\") ))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that female throwers generally tend to be larger (heavier and taller) while distance runners tend to be smaller (lighter and shorter) than the other athletes. Jumpers appear to either be rather tall (likely due to the high jumpers) or have a similar body composition to the sprinters. The short sprinters are in the middle of the pack, they do not appear to be skewed toward either end of either axis, while the mid-distance runners are slightly lighter and shorter than the short sprinters. The sprinters seem to have a similar body type to each other hovering around 170 cm and 60 kg.\n\n\nLook at the code\n# putting it together\n(( p2 <- athletics_m %>% \n  ggplot(aes(height, weight, color=event_type))+\n  geom_point(alpha=0.75)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_color_discrete_qualitative(\"Dark 3\")+\n  labs(title=\"Body Composition of Male \\nOlympic Medalists by Event\\n\", x=\"Height (cm)\", y=\"Weight (kg)\", color=\"Type of Track & Field Event\") ))\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we see similar trends among the male Olympic medalists to the female ones. Throwers dominate the upper right quadrant, meaning they tend to be taller and heavier than the other athletes. Like female distance runners, male distance runners tend to be lighter and shorter than other athletes. Jumpers and sprinters seem to have similar body types with mid-distance runners having a body composition between short sprinters and distance runners.\nI was surprised to see that throwers are so much taller than other athletes because I was assuming that jumpers would far and away be the tallest due to high jumpers. I think that throwers must be both tall and heavy in order to generate the massive amount of force that is required to become an Olympic medalist. The other thing that surprised me was also related to height. Distance runners tended to be shorter than other athletes which was not something that I had noticed before this. I think this has to do with height to weight ratio. Since I assume being light is advantageous for distance runners, being shorter and thus lighter would likely help them.\nOverall, I think that these data are showing similar trends to what I have personally observed about these events. I think that the data are showing that these events attract people of specific sizes, likely because there is some type of advantage to having that build."

    "title": "Development of a Pipeline for Wrangling RNA Seq Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was a Biology major as an undergraduate but I always had a passion for coding. Thus, I was extremely lucky that I had the opportunity to work on both of my academic interests for my thesis. My thesis stemmed from an NSF funded project that my professor and advisor Dr. Rosa León-Zayas was working on in collaboration with Reed College. She was studying a group of bacteria that can eat the plastic that most water bottles are made from (polyethylene terephthalate or PET). If the enzymes involved in the degradation of this plastic are identified, it could help lay the foundation for developing a way to biodegrade plastics in waste treatment facilities, thus helping combat global pollution.\nIn order to identify the enzymes involved, they presented the bacteria with the plastic in a lab setting and sequenced the RNA of the bacteria before and during the exposure to plastic. RNA is a better indicator of what genes are actively expressed rather than what genes are present in an organism. Once they gathered this data, my job was to wrangle and analyze the RNA and translate them to their protein and enzymatic counterparts. Since RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a relatively new procedure, we had to develop a pipeline of the optimal software programs that produced the highest quality data. Through trial and error, my research partner, Grace Sheehan, and I identified that this software flow produced the most optimal data:\n\n\n\nFig. 1 - Flowchart of cleaning RNA-seq data and identifying enzymatic pathways. Created with Biorender.com.\n\n\nThe first step in our project was to clean the RNA-seq data to ensure its quality. We then matched the RNA sequences to each species of bacteria in our sample. Our aim was to determine which genes, and therefore enzymes, might be involved in the degradation of the plastic. To do this, we quantified the levels of gene expression before and after exposure to the plastic and normalized them to transcripts per million (TPM).\nDue to a data loss, we only had data from the plastic-exposed bacteria and not from the control group. However, we were able to overcome this challenge by identifying genes with abnormal levels of gene expression. The RNA sequencing data enabled us to determine what genes were actually being expressed, which helped us generate metabolic pathways for each of the bacteria in our consortium.\nMany of the genes and proteins were unknown in the initial database we used, so we looked for them in other databases. Among the “hypothetical proteins” we found, several enzymes were discovered that could be involved in the degradation of PET plastic. I then proposed a potential enzymatic pathway for the degradation of PET.\n\n\n\nFig. 2 - Potential enzymatic pathway that I identified. This was hypothetical and a more thorough enzymatic pathway has been identified in the publication. Created with Biorender.com.\n\n\nGrace Sheehan and I represented Willamette University and presented our work on this project at the Murdock College Science Research Conference in 2021. This work was later published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences and can be seen here. The work we did here is very exciting for the future of the global environment. If we are able to identify and isolate enzymatic pathways that are involved in the degradation of plastics, we could create natural waste treatment facilities where bacteria are simply eating away our plastic waste. Even better, these bacteria could potentially be genetically engineered to produce their own plastic polymer from our plastic waste, effectively creating a biological recycling plant. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and for the collaboration from Dr. Rosa León-Zayas, Grace Sheehan, and our colleagues at Reed College. I would also like to extend my gratitude to the NSF for funding and the Murdock Trust for giving me the chance to present our work at their conference."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In order to explore my database creation abilities and practice relational database creation and web-scraping from APIs, I created a database of currency rates relative to USD that was scraped once daily from an API. To create a remote database, I needed to deploy a Docker container on a remote server on Railway.app. More on Docker containers here. I scraped the data using R code and set it to gather data once daily. Once scraped, my R code exported these R dataframes to tables in an SQL database.\n\n\n\n\nFig 1. - Entity relationship diagram for currency database. Primary keys and linking relationships are shown.\n\n\nI was curious to see if there was a correlation between GDP growth and currency rates so I scraped GDP data and created another table in my SQL database. I needed to link the currency rates with the GDP of the country so to do this I scraped country names and the currency codes associated with them. I also imported historical data from the time of the GDP growth measurement until the time of my first API scrape. In my SQL database, I created a View that updated with the average currency rate for each month based upon the new data added to the table. I was able to use these tables to perform an analysis on the fastest growing economies as of 2017.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2. - Exchange rates compared to USD for the fastest growing economies of 2017. The US dollar appears to be very strong relative to other currencies.\n\n\nThe results of my analysis appeared to be skewed by how strong the dollar has been performing recently since it seemed that most currencies performed worse relative to USD. I think that these data indicate just how strong the dollar is performing because the performance of the Euro is typically similar to that of the dollar and indicates a strengthening of the dollar in recent times.\nI had a really fun time scraping and creating the database for this project. I find the meticulous work involved in this quite fun and rewarding and I would love to work on more data engineering-type projects. Figuring out how to get everything in the ideal format and work the way I want is always a fun and exciting puzzle. If you have any fun ideas for projects, please do not hesitate to reach out to me here."
