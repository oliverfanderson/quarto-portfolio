	abstract = {The global utilization of single-use, non-biodegradable plastics, such as bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), has contributed to catastrophic levels of plastic pollution. Fortunately, microbial communities are adapting to assimilate plastic waste. Previously, our work showed a full consortium of five bacteria capable of synergistically degrading PET. Using omics approaches, we identified the key genes implicated in PET degradation within the consortium’s pangenome and transcriptome. This analysis led to the discovery of a novel PETase, EstB, which has been observed to hydrolyze the oligomer BHET and the polymer PET. Besides the genes implicated in PET degradation, many other biodegradation genes were discovered. Over 200 plastic and plasticizer degradation-related genes were discovered through the Plastic Microbial Biodegradation Database (PMBD). Diverse carbon source utilization was observed by a microbial community-based assay, which, paired with an abundant number of plastic- and plasticizer-degrading enzymes, indicates a promising possibility for mixed plastic degradation. Using RNAseq differential analysis, several genes were predicted to be involved in PET degradation, including aldehyde dehydrogenases and several classes of hydrolases. Active transcription of PET monomer metabolism was also observed, including the generation of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)/polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biopolymers. These results present an exciting opportunity for the bio-recycling of mixed plastic waste with upcycling potential.},

	abstract = {Graphs are powerful tools for modeling and analyzing molecular interaction networks. Graphs typically represent either undirected physical interactions or directed regulatory relationships, which can obscure a particular protein’s functional context. Graphlets can describe local topologies and patterns within graphs, and combining physical and regulatory interactions offer new graphlet configurations that can provide biological insights.We present GRPhIN, a tool for characterizing graphlets and protein roles within graphlets in mixed physical and regulatory interaction networks. We describe the graphlets of mixed networks in Bacillus subtilis, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and examine local topologies of proteins and subnetworks related to the oxidative stress response pathway. We found a number of graphlets that were abundant in all species, specific node positions (orbits) within graphlets that were overrepresented in stress-associated proteins, and rarely-occurring graphlets that were overrepresented in oxidative stress subnetworks. These results showcase the potential for using graphlets in mixed physical and regulatory interaction networks to identify new patterns beyond a single interaction type.GRPhIN is available at https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/grphin.},

	abstract = {Molecular interaction networks are a vital tool for studying biological systems. While many tools exist that visualize a protein or a pathway within a network, no tool provides the ability for a researcher to consider a protein’s position in a network in the context of a specific biological process or pathway. We developed ProteinWeaver, a web-based tool designed to visualize and analyze non-human protein interaction networks by integrating known biological functions. ProteinWeaver provides users with an intuitive interface to situate a user-specified protein in a user-provided biological context (as a Gene Ontology term) in seven model organisms. ProteinWeaver also reports the presence of physical and regulatory network motifs within the queried subnetwork and statistics about the protein’s distance to the biological process or pathway within the network. These insights can help researchers generate testable hypotheses about the protein’s potential role in the process or pathway under study. Two cell biology case studies demonstrate ProteinWeaver’s potential to generate hypotheses from the queried subnetworks. ProteinWeaver is available at https://proteinweaver.reedcompbio.org/.},
