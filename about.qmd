    <p>I am a big sports science and nutrition nerd and I found an outlet for these passions while competing in Track & Field as a jumper and sprinter at Willamette.</p>

<p>I presented my thesis at the Murdock College Science Research Conference where I developed a pipeline for cleaning and processing data gathered by RNA sequencing. This work was later published in the Internation Journal of Molecular Sciences in collaboration with Reed College. If you would like to find out more about this project, you can check it out along with my other projects <a href="/projects.qmd">here</a>.</p>
