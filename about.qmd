### Expanded Bio

Oliver bridges the gap between biology and computation to make complex molecular systems more interpretable.

During his time at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/ "Reed College") working in the [Ritz CompBio Lab](https://www.reed.edu/biology/ritz/compbiolab.html "Reed Biology Department - Anna Ritz"), he developed **GRPhIN**, an algorithm for counting graphlets in mixed physical and regulatory interaction networks. This work was [published](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbaf176 "GRPhIN: graphlet characterization of regulatory and physical interaction networks"){target="_blank"} in *Bioinformatics Advances* (2025) and presented at the **GL BIO Conference** (2025). He also created **ProteinWeaver**, a [web platform](https://proteinweaver.reedcompbio.org/ "ProteinWeaver website"){target="_blank"} for visualizing mixed interaction networks in the context of Gene Ontology terms, accepted for [publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331280 "ProteinWeaver: A webtool to visualize ontology-annotated protein networks") in *PLOS ONE*.

His earlier research at [Willamette University](https://www.willamette.edu/ "Willamette University") focused on **RNA sequencing pipelines**, resulting in a [publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23105612 "Microbial Consortia and Mixed Plastic Waste: Pangenomic Analysis Reveals Potential for Degradation of Multiple Plastic Types via Previously Identified PET Degrading Bacteria"){target="_blank"} in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* while he was an undergrad. This work was also selected to represent Willamette University in the Life Sciences at the **Murdock College Science Research Conference** (2021). He also earned the **Best Insight Award at DataFest** (2021) for creating a data-driven action-plan for healthcare practitioners.

In addition to research, Oliver has led a **computer science education panel** at the **CCSC-NW Conference** (2024), sharing best practices when creating contributing guides for collaborative research in computer science.

Currently, Oliver works as a **computational biology researcher** at Reed College, while continuing to develop tools that integrate **network biology**, **data science**, and **full-stack software engineering**.

Oliver's personal research interest is the **human microbiome**, specifically the **gut-brain axis** and how **microbial communities** impact **human mood and cognition**. He is also passionate about **sports science** and **nutrition**, and has competed in **Track & Field as a jumper and sprinter** at Willamette University.
