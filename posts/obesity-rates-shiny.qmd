This project uses [**Shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/ "Shiny - R Package") and [**Leaflet**](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/ "Leaflet - R Package") in R to create an interactive map of CDC data on nutrition, exercise, and obesity across the United States. The app was developed in partnership with Hayden Vaughn and is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

You can explore the live version here:\
ðŸ‘‰ [Full Shiny App](https://oliver-f-anderson.shinyapps.io/Obesity_Health_United_States_CDC/ "Obesity and Health in the United States - Shiny App")

## Workflow

1.  **Data source**
    -   CDC public health dataset covering state-level nutrition, physical activity, and obesity indicators.
2.  **Shiny application**
    -   Built with `shiny` for the app structure and reactivity.\
    -   User interface allows selection of different health indicators.
3.  **Leaflet map**
    -   Used `leaflet` for the interactive choropleth map.\
    -   States are shaded according to health indicator values, with hover/click tooltips.
4.  **Deployment**
    -   Hosted on shinyapps.io for public access.

## Discussion

The finished application allows users to explore public health trends interactively. By selecting variables, users can compare how nutrition, exercise, and obesity differ across states.

This project highlights how Râ€™s Shiny and Leaflet packages can be combined to produce data-driven tools for public health communication.

## FAQ: Building Interactive Maps with Shiny and Leaflet

::::::: faqs-container
<details class="faq">

<summary>[How do I add an interactive map to a Shiny app?]{.faq-question}</summary>

::: faq-answer
Use `leafletOutput()` in the UI and `renderLeaflet()` in the server function.
