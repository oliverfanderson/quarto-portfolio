This project was the focus of my undergraduate thesis at [Willamette University](https://willamette.edu/ "Willamette University"), conducted with **Dr. Rosa LeÃ³n-Zayas** and **Grace Sheehan**. The goal was to identify enzymes involved in the biodegradation of [**polyethylene terephthalate (PET)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate "Polyethylene terephthalate - Wikipedia") plastic using bioinformatics and RNA-seq analysis.

## Workflow

1.  **Experimental design**
    -   Bacteria were exposed to PET plastic, and RNA was sequenced to capture gene expression changes.
2.  **Pipeline development**
    -   Built a custom RNA-seq pipeline for cleaning, alignment, and expression analysis ([Fig. 1](#fig-1)).\
    -   Ensured reproducibility and accuracy despite data loss in one control group.
3.  **Gene and enzyme analysis**
    -   Identified abnormal expression patterns linked to PET exposure.\
    -   Mapped expression results to protein and enzymatic functions.
4.  **Metabolic pathway reconstruction**
    -   Proposed a hypothetical pathway for PET degradation ([Fig. 2](#fig-2)).\
    -   Validated results against enzyme databases and literature.

## Results

Through database searches, we found evidence of previously uncharacterized enzymes that may contribute to PET degradation. The metabolic pathways constructed from RNA-seq data showed promising targets for future biodegradation research.

## Discussion

This work resulted in a **publication** and a **conference presentation**:\
- Presented at the *Murdock College Science Research Conference*\
- Published in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences*:\
ðŸ‘‰ [Microbial Consortia and Mixed Plastic Waste: Pangenomic Analysis Reveals Potential for Degradation of Multiple Plastic Types via Previously Identified PET Degrading Bacteria](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/10/5612 "Publication URL")

The findings suggest opportunities for developing natural waste treatment systems using bacteria, as well as the possibility of engineering organisms to synthesize new plastic polymers from waste.
