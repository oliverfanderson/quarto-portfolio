GRPhIN (Graphlet Characterization of Regulatory and Physical Interaction Networks) is an algorithm for counting graphlets and the specific node positions within each graphlet (called orbits) in mixed regulatory and physical interaction networks. Graph representions of regulatory or physical interactions in isolation may obscure the complete functional context of a protein. PPI networks and GRNs do not exist separately; proteins are transcription factors, genes encode proteins, and physical and regulatory interactions mix and coexist forming their own distinct patterns. Graphlets are small, connected, induced subnetworks that describe patterns, local topologies, and organization in networks.

GRPhIN takes as input (1) an undirected PPI network and (2) a directed regulatory network and counts all mixed graphlets and their respective orbits ([Figure 6](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/motifs/blob/main/Complete%20Graphlet%20%26%20Orbit%20Definitions.pdf)). GRPhIN provides additional functional context to the roles a protein may play beyond traditional isolated network types.

B) Sorting node orbits in ascending order maintains a unique graphlet structure. C) Sorting isomorphisms result in the same unique set of integer pairs.</figcaption>

I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with Altaf Barelvi and Dr. Anna Ritz on this project and get hands on experience developing algorithms.
