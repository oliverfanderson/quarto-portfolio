In order to explore my database creation abilities and practice relational database creation and web-scraping from APIs, I created a database of currency rates relative to USD that was scraped once daily from an [API](https://api.exchangerate.host/latest/?base=USD). To create a remote database, I needed to deploy a Docker container on a remote server on Railway.app. More on Docker containers [here](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/). I scraped the data using R code and set it to gather data once daily. Once scraped, my R code exported these R dataframes to tables in an SQL database.

I was curious to see if there was a correlation between GDP growth and currency rates so I scraped [GDP data](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/) and created another table in my SQL database. I needed to link the currency rates with the GDP of the country so to do this I scraped [country names and the currency codes](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) associated with them. I also imported historical data from the time of the GDP growth measurement until the time of my first API scrape. In my SQL database, I created a View that updated with the average currency rate for each month based upon the new data added to the table. I was able to use these tables to perform an analysis on the fastest growing economies as of 2017.

The results of my analysis appeared to be skewed by how strong the dollar has been performing recently since it seemed that most currencies performed worse relative to USD. I think that these data indicate just how strong the dollar is performing because the performance of the Euro is typically similar to that of the dollar and indicates a strengthening of the dollar in recent times.

I had a really fun time scraping and creating the database for this project. I find the meticulous work involved in this quite fun and rewarding and I would love to work on more data engineering-type projects. Figuring out how to get everything in the ideal format and work the way I want is always a fun and exciting puzzle.
